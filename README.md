# MSP430_WorkSpace
Command line environment to enable the use of RedHat/TI open source GCC

This project was inspired by the need for a command line environment for Windows that is portable with a memory stick. The idea is to provide a simple development environment that can be used with any Windows machine. My own need for such a system was what drove the project.
